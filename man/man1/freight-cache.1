.
.SH "NAME"
\fBfreight\-cache\fR \- (re)builds package repositories
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBfreight cache\fR [\fB\-g\fR \fIemail\fR] [\fB\-c\fR \fIconf\fR] [\fB\-V\fR] [\fB\-v\fR] [\fB\-h\fR] \fImanager\fR/\fIdistro\fR\.\.\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBfreight\-cache\fR converts each \fImanager\fR/\fIdistro\fR given into a package repository (only Debian archives are supported currently)\. The \fImanager\fR indicates the type of repository (again, \fBapt\fR is the only supported value)\. The \fIdistro\fR is an arbitrary string that should match a release of the target operating system (for example, "lenny" or "lucid")\.
.
.P
Packages are read from the Freight library (\fB$VARLIB\fR in the configuration, see \fBfreight\fR(5)) and organized into a working repository in the Freight cache (\fB$VARCACHE\fR in the configuration)\.
.
.P
Serving the repositories is left as an exercise for the reader\. The Freight cache is the only directory that needs to be exposed, so create a virtual host with \fB$VARCACHE\fR as its document root and everything will be fine\.
